This theme is a light dark beginner-friendly theme for VS Code.<br><br>
I am myself a bloody beginner in learning `Python` and I couldn't find a theme which was
dark and offered a clear distinction between syntax like `variables`, `keywords`,
`classes`, `operators` etc.<br><br>
It has been created using [Theme Studio for VS Code](https://themes.vscode.one/). Thank
you Mike for creating this very helpful website!<br><br>
So far I've only been using this theme with `Python`, I do not know what it will look like with different languages.
If you think I could improve anything, [please let me
know](https://github.com/smoochy/smooTheme/issues/new/choose).
